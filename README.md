Kinect Movement Projection Project

Using Processing, MAX MSP, & a Kinect camera, it's an animation where a user can control the images onscreen. I projected it to serve as a public art display. I created the video background using Adobe Premiere. 

Art statement meant to "ease" the user's stress to current world tragedies like Covid by allowing them the agency to swipe away at the images to reveal something much more aesthetically pleasing.

For a complete runthrough & documentation of project please look at the website I created for this project https://villalobosctatiana.wixsite.com/my-site
